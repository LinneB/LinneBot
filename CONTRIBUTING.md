### Linting and formatting

This project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev) for linting and formatting. There are NPM scripts for both if you can't be bothered to install the plugin for your editor.

**Make sure you run `npm run lint` and `npm run format` before commiting**

### Conventional commits

When commiting, make sure to follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) convention.

When opening issues and pull requests, make sure to tag it properly (feature request, question, etc.)
